This vital resource serves as a beacon of hope and learning for the surrounding communities, including the densely populated Mekanissa and Kore condominium areas, where access to public libraries is limited. The library also plays a significant role in supporting children from the Kori Kids project who live near the Addis Ababa landfill area (Koshe), offering them a safe and nurturing environment to read, learn, and grow. \n\nAfter being closed for over two years, OfLaD's efforts have transformed CLiC into a thriving community hub. The library attracts an average of 30 visitors daily, ranging from young children and students to parents and professionals. With its extensive collection of books, digital learning tools, and interactive programs, the library caters to diverse learning needs and fosters a love for reading. \n\nBeyond providing access to knowledge, CLiC hosts various community-led initiatives, such as literacy workshops, book clubs, and educational seminars. These programs are designed to promote lifelong learning, social connection, and personal development. Through partnerships with local schools, volunteers, and other organizations, the library continues to expand its impact by addressing educational inequalities and empowering underprivileged communities. \n\nThe reopening and ongoing management of CLiC exemplify OfLaD’s commitment to creating inclusive and accessible spaces where individuals of all ages can unlock their potential. By bridging gaps in education and fostering a culture of learning, CLiC serves as a cornerstone for building a brighter future for the communities it serves."

These exhibitions bring stories to life through captivating storytelling sessions, creative workshops, and engaging activities that appeal to all age groups. With vibrant displays and hands-on interactions, attendees are encouraged to explore books, discover new genres, and develop a deeper connection to the world of literature. \n\nCollaboration is at the heart of these events. OfLaD works alongside schools, libraries, local publishers, authors, and volunteers to curate diverse collections of books that reflect the interests and cultural backgrounds of the community. By organizing book donation drives as part of the exhibitions, we ensure that children from underprivileged backgrounds gain access to high-quality books and reading materials. These donations not only support individual literacy but also contribute to building libraries in underserved schools and communities. \n\nWorkshops at the exhibitions include creative writing sessions, reading strategy tutorials, and discussions about the importance of literacy in personal and professional growth. Authors and educators participate as facilitators, sharing their expertise and inspiring attendees to think critically and imaginatively. Parents and guardians are actively engaged through sessions designed to help them nurture reading habits at home, ensuring the learning continues beyond the exhibition. \n\nThese exhibitions are not just events but milestones in OfLaD's mission to create a society where reading is celebrated, knowledge is valued, and literacy is accessible to all. By making books more engaging and fostering community-wide involvement, OfLaD transforms reading from a solitary activity into a shared cultural experience, empowering the next generation with the tools they need to succeed."

Our storytelling sessions, often led by authors, teachers, and community role models, create an engaging and immersive experience that captivates young minds. \n\nIn addition to sparking interest in reading, the festivals promote the importance of parental involvement in children's literacy journeys. Parents are encouraged to participate in reading workshops, where they learn practical tips on fostering a reading culture at home. Educators benefit from professional development opportunities that focus on creative teaching methods to enhance reading engagement in classrooms. \n\nThese festivals are more than just events; they are a movement to build a reading culture that extends beyond the festivities. By embedding a love for reading in communities and reinforcing the importance of lifelong learning, OfLaD strives to create an environment where education is celebrated and knowledge is shared across generations."
